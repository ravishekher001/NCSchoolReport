    "* For this project will be using North Carolina Schools education data. The data is a combination of multiple data tables publicly available by the North Carolina Department of Public Instruction (NCDPI) which is charged with implementing the state's public-school laws and the State Board of Education's policies and procedures governing pre-kindergarten through 12th grade public education. You can learn more about the data by visiting http://www.ncpublicschools.org/data/reports/\n",
    "\n",
    "* Our starting datasets[All_Data_By_School_Final] and [1516_Test_Scores] were taken from Dr. Drews GitHub where he combines multiple datasets from North Carolina Schools education data, preprocesses them and cleans for Machine learning. You can learn more on the data set from Dr. Drew's GitHub https://github.com/jakemdrew/EducationDataNC.\n",

    "* We performed Visualization on s subset of the data targeted for schools with `high schools`, which can be accessed from https://github.com/kevimwe/NC_EDUCATION_DATA/tree/master/NC_EDUC_Visualization_Data_Processing.\n"

    "> From above we note, of the 304 columns in SchoolData, 228 (74.8%) of them have some missing data. 32(10.5%) of columns have all the data missing where 39 (12.8%) of the columns miss more than 95% of the data. For columns with 100% missing data we are left but to wonder if this were new fields introduced recently and the schools are not fully informed to collect this data or the data for this columns was not just collected by mistake. On the other hand, for the partally completed datasets, some schools might have left these columns blank if they didn't apply to them.\n",

If we complete this large amount of missing rows of data with predetermined data, our model maybe baised and throw were predictions off."

The features of the minority class are treated as noise and are often ignored. Thus, there is a high probability of misclassification of the minority class as compared to the majority class.  This is particular important aspect to consider for our model where our predicted variable summer_program_flag is imbalanced with False: 1702 and True: 877 observations. \n",

    "> Logistic regression works well for predicting categorical outcomes like admission and rejection but not continuous like graduation rate which what we plan to predict in Lab 2. We were tempted to attempt to convert the graduation rate into discrete categories like \"high graduation\" or \"low graduation\", based on a selected threshold but by doing so we would sacrifice the precision of the data set. This is a significant disadvantage when working with data on a continuous scale. Considering that we decided to classify schools based on whether they have a summer program or not which was already a categorical variable.\n",
