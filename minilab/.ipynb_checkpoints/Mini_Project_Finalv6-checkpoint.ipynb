    "* For this project we'll be using the North Carolina Schools education data set. The data is a combination of multiple data tables publicly available by the North Carolina Department of Public Instruction (NCDPI) which is charged with implementing the state's public-school laws and the State Board of Education's policies and procedures governing pre-kindergarten through 12th grade public education. You can learn more about the data by visiting http://www.ncpublicschools.org/data/reports/\n",
    "\n",
    "* Our starting datasets [All_Data_By_School_Final] and [1516_Test_Scores] were taken from Dr. Drews GitHub where he combines multiple datasets from North Carolina Schools education data, preprocesses them and cleans for Machine learning. You can learn more on the data set from Dr. Drew's GitHub https://github.com/jakemdrew/EducationDataNC.\n",
    "\n",
    "* We performed Visualization on a subset of the data targeted for schools with `high schools`, which can be accessed from https://github.com/kevimwe/NC_EDUCATION_DATA/tree/master/NC_EDUC_Visualization_Data_Processing.\n"

The loss function can be set via the `loss` parameter.

Any interior points aren't going to affect the boundary. Once the support vectors are identified, all other instances in the training data could be deleted without changing the position of the dividing hyperplane\n"

    "\n",
    "> * ** `Overfitting the Model: `**\n",
    "> Logistic regression tends to be vulnerable to overconfidence in cases involving imbalanced classes. In such cases, Logistic regression model tends to only predict the majority class data. The features of the minority class are treated as noise and are often ignored. Thus, there is a high probability of misclassification of the minority class as compared to the majority class.  This is a particular important aspect to consider for our model where our predicted variable summer_program_flag is imbalanced with False: 1702 and True: 877 observations. \n",
    "\n",
    ">    Reference: https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2017/03/imbalanced-classification-problem/\n",
    ">* **`Limited Outcome Variables: `** \n",
    "> Logistic regression works well for predicting categorical outcomes like admission and rejection but not continuous like graduation rate which what we plan to predict in Lab 2. We were tempted to attempt to convert the graduation rate into discrete categories like \"high graduation\" or \"low graduation\", based on a selected threshold but by doing so we would sacrifice the precision of the data set. This is a significant disadvantage when working with data on a continuous scale. Considering that we decided to classify schools based on whether they have a summer program or not which was already a categorical variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "> ** SVM **\n",
    "\n",
    "> * **`Long training time on large data sets: ` **\n",
    "> Not considering stochastic gradient descent, SVM is Computationally expensive, thus runs slow.  Shown below, it took 7.36 sec to train an SVM model vs 1.4 seconds needed on the small dataset. These times are bound to scale exponentially for a larger dataset.\n"

    "The average size of a second grade class at the district level being the highest weighted variable gives us pause. Since we see other elementary classes at the district level with high weights there may perhaps be an interaction between class size and school category that influence whether a school has a summer program. The idea behind this being that schools which have elementary grades would, or would not, have a summer school program depending on the number of students at the school.\n",

    "The next highest variable, lea_nbpts_num, lends itself to an easier interpretation. This variable represents the number of National Board Certified staff at the district level. To earn this certification, teachers must have taught for more than 3 years, pay the $1,900 fee, and pass the certification process which may take up to five years to complete (http://www.teachhub.com/national-board-certification-why-how-get-it). Teachers who complete such a rigorous process display an intellect and passion that could lead them to push for summer school programs, making it easy to see why having a high number of teachers with this certification would impact a school having these programs or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a number of variables which we will group together for the next bit of analysis which we believe to be financially driven; scity_ad_Fayetteville, stud_internet_comp_num, scity_ad_Durham, wap_per_classroom, and title1_type_flg. The city fields listed could have more money to pay for summer programs, or perhaps the cities believe summer school programs to be an initiative worth pursuing and therefor the schools within this city tend to have such programs. The number of students with internet connected computers and the number of wireless application protocol devices per program would be higher in schools which had more money. It would seem reasonable that a school that can afford to have a high number of these devices would also be able to have summer programs. If the summer programs were of a technical nature, then this would be even more reason for schools that possess this equipment to offer them. The title1_type_flg variable represents schools that have Title 1 Status. The Title 1 program provides financial assistance to schools with a high percentage of poor students. Allocating some of this money towards summer school programs seems a reasonable assumption.\n"
