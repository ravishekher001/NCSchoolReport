    "### Introduction\n",
    "* For this project will be using North Carolina Schools education data. The data is a combination of multiple data tables publicly available by the North Carolina Department of Public Instruction (NCDPI) which is charged with implementing the state's public school laws and the State Board of Education's policies and procedures governing pre-kindergarten through 12th grade public education. You can learn more about the data by visiting http://www.ncpublicschools.org/data/reports/\n",
    "\n",
    "* Our starting datasets[All_Data_By_School_Final] and [1516_Test_Scores] were taken from Dr. Drews github where he combines multiple datasets from North Carolina Schools education data, preprocesses them and cleans for Machine learning. You can learn more on the data set from Dr.Drew's github https://github.com/jakemdrew/EducationDataNC.\n",
    "\n",
    "* We performed Visualization on s usbset of the data targeted for schools with `high schools`, which can be accessed from https://github.com/kevimwe/NC_EDUCATION_DATA/tree/master/NC_EDUC_Visualization_Data_Processing."
