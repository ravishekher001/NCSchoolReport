    "* For this project will be using North Carolina Schools education data. The data is a combination of multiple data tables publicly available by the North Carolina Department of Public Instruction (NCDPI) which is charged with implementing the state's public school laws and the State Board of Education's policies and procedures governing pre-kindergarten through 12th grade public education. You can learn more about the data by visiting http://www.ncpublicschools.org/data/reports/\n",
    "\n",
    "* Our starting datasets[All_Data_By_School_Final] and [1516_Test_Scores] were taken from Dr. Drews github where he combines multiple datasets from North Carolina Schools education data, preprocesses them and cleans for Machine learning. You can learn more on the data set from Dr.Drew's github https://github.com/jakemdrew/EducationDataNC.\n",
    "\n",
    "* We performed Visualization on s usbset of the data targeted for schools with `high schools`, which can be accessed from https://github.com/kevimwe/NC_EDUCATION_DATA/tree/master/NC_EDUC_Visualization_Data_Processing."

Once the support vectors are identified, all others instances in the training data could be deleted without changing the position of the dividing hyperplane\n"

    "\n",
    "> * ** `Overfitting the Model: `**\n",
    "> Logistic regression tends to be vulnerable to overconfidence in cases involving imbalanced classes. In such cases, Logistic regression model tends to only predict the majority class data. The features of the minority class are treated as noise and are often ignored. Thus, there is a high probability of misclassification of the minority class as compared to the majority class.  This is particular important aspect to consider for our model where our predicted variable summer_program_flag is imbalanced with False: 1702 and True: 877 observations. \n",
    "\n",
    ">    Reference: https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2017/03/imbalanced-classification-problem/\n",
    ">* **`Limited Outcome Variables: `** \n",
    "> Logistic regression works well for predicting categorical outcomes like admission and rejection but not continuous like graduation rate which what we plan to predict in Lab 2. We were tempted to attempt to convert the graduation rate into discrete categories like \"high graduation\" or \"low graduation\", based on a selected threshold but by doing so we would sacrifice the precision of the data set. This is a significant disadvantage when working with data on a continuous scale. Considering that we decided to classify schools based on whether they have a summer program or not which was already a categorical variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "> ** SVM **\n",
    "\n",
    "> * **`Long training time on large data sets: ` **\n",
    "> Not considering stochastic gradient descent, SVM is Computationally expensive, thus runs slow.  Shown below, it took 7.36 sec to train an SVM model vs 1.4 seconds needed on the small dataset. These times are bound to scale exponentially for a larger dataset.\n"
