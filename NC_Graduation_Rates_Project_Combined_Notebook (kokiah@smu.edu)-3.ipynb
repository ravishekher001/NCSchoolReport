    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "> The North Carolina Department of Public Instruction (NCDPI) is charged with implementing the state's public school laws and the State Board of Education's policies and procedures governing pre-kindergarten through 12th grade public education. The elected State Superintendent of Public Instruction leads the Department and functions under the policy direction of the State Board of Education.\n",
    "\n",
    "> The agency provides leadership and service to the 115 local public school districts and 2,500+ traditional public schools, 150+ charter schools, and the three residential schools for students with hearing and visual impairments. The areas of support include curriculum and instruction, accountability, finance, teacher and administrator preparation and licensing, professional development and school business support and operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "> The NCDPI develops the Standard Course of Study, which describes the subjects and course content that is taught in North Carolina public schools, and the assessments and accountability model used to evaluate student, school and district success.\n",
    "\n",
    "> The NCDPI administers annual state and federal public school funds totaling approximately $9.2 billion and licenses the approximately 117,000 teachers and administrators who serve public schools. The NCDPI's primary offices are in Raleigh, with four regional alternative licensing centers in Concord, Fayetteville, Elm City and Catawba. Approximately 30,000 new teacher and administrator licenses are issued annually from these centers. The NCDPI's work extends to the NC Center for the Advancement of Teaching with locations in Cullowhee and Ocracoke, and the NC Virtual Public School â€“ the second largest virtual public school in the nation. The state agency also works closely with nine Regional Education Service Alliances/ Consortia and six regional accountability offices.\n",
    "\n",
    "** The mission, vision and goals of the Public Schools of North Carolina is as follows: **\n",
    "\n",
    "**VISION:**\n",
    "> Every public school student will graduate ready for post secondary education and work, prepared to be a globally engaged and \n",
    "> productive citizen\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**MISSION:**\n",
    "> The State Board of Education has the constitutional authority to lead and uphold the system of public education in North \n",
    "> Carolina.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**GOALS:**\n",
    "> Goal: Every student in the NC Public School System graduates from high school prepared for work, further education and \n",
    "> citizenship.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> Goal: Every student has a personalized education.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> Goal: Every student, every day has excellent educators.\n",

    "> Goal: Every school district has up-to-date financial, business, and technology systems to serve its students, parents and \n",

    "> For this project will be using North Carolina High Schools education data. The data is a combination of multiple data tables publicly available by the North Carolina Department of Public Instruction (NCDPI)  which is charged with implementing the state's public school laws and the State Board of Education's policies and procedures governing pre-kindergarten through 12th grade public education. You can learn more about the data by visiting http://www.ncpublicschools.org/data/reports/\n",
    "\n",
    "> The data is collected in an effort to compile all measurable state-wide statistics on schools in North Carolina to inform and \n",
    "educate all stakeholders on the state of the educational system.  \n",
    "\n",
    "> Once compiled and preprocessed, the data could then be mined to answer multiple questions like: what are key factors that \n",
    "increase SAT/ACT scores, and how can schools retain masterful teachers, and ultimately, identify factors within schools that \n",
    "can increase graduation rates. \n",
    "\n",
    "> The data should be harnessed to hightlight ways and strategies on how to improve the strengths and weaknesses of the school system at large.\n",
    "     \n",
    "    \n",
    "* __Describe how you would define and measure the outcomes from the dataset.__  \n",
    "\n",
    "> Our initial goal is to understand how the education system in North Carolina is at the moment and interpretating the State  theme 'Educating the Whole Child'. \n",
    "\n",
    "> Examining the mission and vision of the public school systems would help guide us to zoom in on certain objective measureable criteria within the data, like how can the such as increase trends in various school features that examine both formative and summative scores and quantitative and  qualativity data that are indicitive of the essentials of a successful school system. \n",
    "\n",
    "> What parts of the state  have low test scores? Do some schools have better access to computers for the students? How does the state allocate funds to the districts? By investigating these questions, and others like them, we will have a more wholistic understanding of the dataset. \n",
    "          \n",
    "* __How would you measure the effectiveness of a good prediction algorithm?__ \n",
    "\n",
    "> Our team aims to predict the graduation rate of High Schools in the state of North Carolina based on the multiple features taken from the North Carolina dataset motivated by the mission vision and goals of the education system. To access the effectiveness of our algorithm we will begin by performing regression diagnostics for any unusual data and nonlinearity in our model. We will look at MSE, MAE, or RMSE among others to see how well our model fits the data. To guage the accuracy of our model, a 5 fold Cross-Validation will be performed.\n",
    "\n",
    "> If the results shows innovation and suggestions what is known best practices or even better leads to new information that was unseen and forecasted by tradition means and current policies, procedures, and protocals.\n",

    "> The drill down structure of this bar graph allows us to view graduation rates aggregated to the region and district level, as well as per school. We can see at the region level that graduation rates are strong overall with the lowest region being SandHills at 86.07%. As an example of how this visualization can be utilized we will investigate the SandHills reason to locate the problem areas. From the district tab we navigate to the SandHills region column and can see that of it's 13 districts, 2 are below the 80% threshold with another district fairly close to the cut-off. (Charter Schools: 78.60&, Moore County Schools: 77.33%, Montgomery County Schools: 80.40%). To see which schools are bringing these three district's graduation rates down we go to the School tab. When we look at Charter Schools we see that only one school, Flemington Academy (78.60%), of the 9 in this district reported graduation rates. (It is important to note here that there are Charter School districts in all regions so it is necessary to navigate to the SandHill section before looking at the desired Charter School district). In the Moore County Schools district we see that 4 of the 21 schools report graduation rates with the lowest being The Community Learning Center @ Pinckney (38.90%). And finally, in the Montgomery County Schools district 3 of the 10 schools report graduation rates with the lowest being Montgomery Learning Academy (54.20%). Some of these schools do not report graduation rates, as defined by the variable, because they are elementry schools and as such have no bearing on our current analysis. We can use this information on regions, districts, and schools in an effort to quickly locate trouble spots. Once these at-risk schools are found, we can investigate possible causes as to why they have lower than average graduation rates."
